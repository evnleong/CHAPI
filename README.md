# CHAPI_personal_repo

This is a personal fork of the CHAPI repository used as a testbed for developing the CHAPI housing sort algorithm. 

## Introduction 

CHAPI is a custom application powered by an algorithm being developed by Cornell Students to automate the summer conference housing and planning process. 
By the time the algorithm is completed, CHAPI should be able to generate solution scores for proposed housing placements of conference attendees and display to CES planners a heirarchy of placement options. 


## Current Progress 
Currently, the progress of this CHAPI testbed is at the data parsing phase. Using HTTP Basic Auth, we are able to pull housing base data from StarRez, which is Cornell's housing database.
